# Bret Victor's Quote Dataset

So the amazing master Bret Victor, has this [amazing quotes page](https://worrydream.com/quotes/) where he has collected many interesting and amazing quotes over the years.

I have made a tiny one-line code that scraps the page into a nice JSON for anyone to make things with the data. (Screen savers, widgets, stuff like that...)

## Cli App.

The CLI app can be built on UNIX via running `build-cli.sh`
